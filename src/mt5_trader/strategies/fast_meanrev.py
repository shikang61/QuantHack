"""Fast mean reversion: fade short-term deviations from a rolling mean.

The idea the operator asked for — catch short-term dips and rises. Price drops
far below its rolling mean (z <= -z_entry) -> go long (expect a bounce); spikes
above (z >= +z_entry) -> go short (expect a pullback); flatten near the mean
(|z| <= z_exit). State machine so it holds the fade until the mean is recovered,
not flip every bar.

Defaults assume M1 bars. This is a TAKER fade and is sensitive to costs; run it
through run_backtest.py at --slippage-bps 0 vs 2 to see the impact.
